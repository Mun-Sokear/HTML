            <p>Angkor Wat is a temple complex in Cambodia and is the largest religious monument in the world, originally constructed as a Hindu temple dedicated to the god Vishnu for the Khmer Empire, gradually transforming into a Buddhist temple towards the end of the 12th century.</p>

            <p>World Heritage site, any of various areas or objects inscribed on the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) World Heritage List. </p>
            </p>The sites are designated as having “outstanding universal value” under the Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage.</p>
            </p> This document was adopted by UNESCO in 1972 and formally took effect in 1975 after having been ratified by 20 countries. It provides a framework for international cooperation in preserving and protecting cultural treasures and natural areas throughout the world</p>
            <p>Angkor Wat, temple complex at Angkor, near Siem Reap, Cambodia, that was built in the 12th century by King Suryavarman II (reigned 1113–c. 1150) of the Khmer empire. The vast religious complex of Angkor Wat comprises more than a thousand buildings, and it is one of the great cultural wonders of the world. Angkor Wat is the world’s largest religious structure, covering some 400 acres (160 hectares), and marks the high point of Khmer architecture.

                View of Angkor Wat, Cambodia's most famous temple and a UNESCO World Heritage site.
                The city of Angkor served as the royal center from which a dynasty of Khmer kings ruled one of the largest, most prosperous, and most sophisticated kingdoms in the history of Southeast Asia. From the end of the 9th century until early in the 13th century, numerous construction projects were undertaken, the most notable of which was Angkor Wat. It was built by Suryavarman II as a vast funerary temple within which his remains were to be deposited. Construction is believed to have spanned some three decades</p>

                <h1>Architecturally, the elements characteristic of the style include the ogival, redented towers shaped like lotus buds; half-galleries to broaden passageways; axial galleries connecting enclosures; and the cruciform terraces which appear along the main axis of the temple.Khmer temples were typically enclosed by a concentric series of walls, with the central sanctuary in the middle; this arrangement represented the mountain ranges surrounding Mount Meru, the mythical home of the gods. Enclosures are the spaces between these walls, and between the innermost wall and the temple itself.</h1>
        <p>Angkor Wat combines two basic plans of Khmer temple architecture: the temple-mountain and the later galleried temples. </p>
          </p>  It is designed to represent Mount Meru, home of the devas in Hindu mythology, a symbol of the center of the universe.</p>

        <p>Angkor Wat is located in Siem Reap, Cambodia. Visitors can explore the temple complex and also visit nearby temples such as Bayon and Ta Prohm. It is best to visit during the dry season from November to March.</p>
        <p>There are few experiences in all my travels that I recall with greater clarity or fondness than the magical time I spent exploring the Angkor Archaeological Park.

            I remember waking up in the earliest part of the morning when there was still a thick layer of fog. I remember getting into a tuk-tuk with my partner, Briana, and arriving just as the sun was keen to peak out its knowing head. I remember being entranced by the famed spiraled towers of Angkor Wat, and I stood there, completely in awe, with nothing to do but soak in the sun’s rays and the temple’s majesty.
            
            Visiting Cambodia‘s Angkor Wat is like being granted the keys to another world for a short period of time. While I was there, I often imagined in my head that, like a certain CS Lewis novel, I must have walked through a closet and into another realm.</p>
            <p>Angkor Wat is the prized temple and showpiece of what is now known as the Angkor Archaeological Park. The city of Angkor itself was built in the 12th century to be an unparalleled Khmer capital for King Suryavarman II. When built, the ancient city extended over 400 kilometres, which makes it the largest pre-industrial city in history. While guesses about the city’s population vary wildly, some prominent historians suggest that the population could have been as high as one million people. Mysteriously, archaeologists are still unsure of what actually happened to this vast empire and its people.

                What I didn’t know when I visited, but learned after through further reading, is that the Angkor Archaeological Park shouldn’t really be conceptualized as a collection of disparate temples and monuments in a jungle. This was a fully functioning, complex city that was well-connected, and these temples were just a part of that burgeoning city.</p>
